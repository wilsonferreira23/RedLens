# Reporting Workflow Playbook

Use after testing, or throughout testing to keep evidence ready for a final report.

For professional deliverables, use `../reporting/professional-report-standard.md` and `../reporting/finding-schema.md` as the report contract.

## Inputs

- Authorized scope and test dates.
- Confirmed findings, raw tool output, screenshots, requests/responses, and notes.
- Required report format and audience.

## Workflow

1. **Executive summary**
   - Write a 1-2 page high-level risk narrative for leadership before detailing individual findings.
   - Cover: engagement scope, testing approach and methodology, key risk themes identified, count of critical and high findings, and overall risk posture assessment.
   - Keep language non-technical — frame risks in business impact terms (data exposure, service disruption, regulatory consequence).
   - This section is the first thing stakeholders read; ensure it stands alone as a meaningful summary.

2. **Normalize evidence**
   - Group evidence by finding, affected asset, severity, and proof.
   - Keep raw tool output separate from analyst conclusions.

   (See `../reporting/README.md` for reporting tool selection.)

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/report/{evidence/{screenshots,scans,raw},findings}
   cat nuclei_findings.jsonl | jq -r '[.info.severity, .info.name, .host] | @tsv' > /tmp/report/finding_summary.tsv
   ```

3. **Validate findings**
   - Confirm each finding has reproducible evidence.
   - Remove duplicates and mark false positives clearly.
   - For tool-only findings, add manual or second-tool validation when feasible.

   **Finding completeness check:** Verify that every tested service and every tool run has at least one finding or an explicit negative-result entry. Do not leave tested services undocumented — negative results are evidence that testing was performed.

4. **Assign severity**
   - Rate impact and likelihood in context.
   - Note exploitability, authentication requirement, exposure, and compensating controls.
   - Use CVSS v4.0 base score calculation as the default: Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, and CIA impact. Use CVSS v3.1 when the client specifically requests it or when comparing against vulnerability databases that have not migrated to v4.0.
   - Apply Environmental and Temporal adjustments when the target environment context is known (e.g., compensating controls, exploit maturity).
   - Reference the [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0) for consistent scoring.
   - Where relevant, map findings to compliance frameworks: PCI DSS requirements, SOC 2 trust criteria, or HIPAA safeguards.

5. **Write findings**
   - Include title, severity, affected assets, impact, evidence, reproduction steps, and remediation.
   - Avoid unsupported claims and clearly state limitations.

6. **Create supporting artifacts**
   - Before generating the report, copy all tool outputs and evidence files produced during the test from the remote environment to the host; report generation should run on the host.
   - Use `gowitness` for screenshots when needed (see `../information-gathering/tools/gowitness.md`).
   - Use `pandoc` for format conversion when requested (see `../reporting/tools/pandoc.md`).
   - Use `../reporting/tools/report-template.md` as the base structure.
   - Write long reports in sections rather than as a single operation to avoid write failures.

   ```bash
   # gowitness v2 syntax
   gowitness file -f urls.txt --screenshot-path /tmp/report/evidence/screenshots/
   # gowitness v3 syntax (Kali 2024+)
   gowitness scan file -f urls.txt --screenshot-path /tmp/report/evidence/screenshots/
   pandoc /tmp/report/report.md -o /tmp/report/report.pdf --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf
   ```

   Transfer evidence from the test environment to the report host before generating the report:

   ```bash
   # Copy evidence from remote Kali over SSH
   scp -r user@kali:/tmp/pentest_evidence/ /tmp/report/evidence/
   # Or copy evidence from a Docker container
   docker cp kali-pentest:/tmp/pentest_evidence/ /tmp/report/evidence/
   ```

   **Multi-source evidence collection:** Evidence may be on multiple hosts — Kali server (nmap, nuclei, hashcat outputs), target hosts (linpeas, config files, bash_history), pivot hosts (additional scan outputs), and the local workstation (screenshots, notes). Collect from all sources before generating the report.

   6b. **Remediation prioritization**
   - Order fixes by: risk severity x ease of exploitation x business impact.
   - Group related findings that share a common root cause or remediation path.
   - Identify quick wins (low effort, high impact) vs long-term improvements (architectural changes, process updates).
   - Note dependencies between remediations — for example, fixing a shared authentication flaw may resolve multiple downstream findings.

7. **Peer review**
   - Before final delivery, conduct a peer review covering:
     - Technical accuracy: are findings correctly described and categorized?
     - Reproducibility: can each finding be reproduced using the documented steps?
     - Sensitive data redaction: verify no client credentials, tokens, or PII appear in the report body or evidence.
     - Severity consistency: are similar findings rated at the same severity across the report?
     - Spelling and grammar check on all narrative sections.

8. **Final review**
   - Check scope alignment, sensitive data handling, command log accuracy, and artifact references.
   - Include important negative results and unreachable-target notes when they affect conclusions.
